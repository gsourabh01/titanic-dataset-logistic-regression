# titanic-dataset-logistic-regression
We are going to build a Logistic Regression model using a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster. Then we check the performance of the model on a test dataset to evaluate how well the model is able to predict whether these passengers of the test dataset survived or not.
